# Interests

As a biophysical geographer, I study various physical and biological processes as they relate through space and time. More specifically, my research interests are in the realm of coastal wetland remote sensing, biogeochemistry, and other biophysical processes. I study how remote sensing can be used in tandem with field-based data to make assess landscape and spatial responses to disturbance and environmental change. I am particularly interested in managed and restored systems and how these data can help in the assessment and management of these wetlands. Additionally, I have a strong interest in developing better data literacy, data systems, and data science for the betterment of the environment. 

Below are some research projects that I have contributed to.

# Current Projects

## SBG SHIFT Field Campaign

In collaboration with scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), I am participating in a pathfinder mission for JPL's Surface Biology and Geology Mission that will be aiming to collect plant traits, such as C, N, P content, pigments, etc., and relate them to a dense time series of hyperspectral imagery collected by AVIRIS over the Santa Barbara area. My role is currently focused on sampling efforts for wetlands that fall within the flight path. My current research interest in the context of the larger mission is the collection of salinity data and ways that we can connect ground based metrics of soil salinity to remotely sensed data so we can track and predict soil changes in intermittently tidal salt marshes.   

## Bulk Density Effects on Coastal Sage Scrub

Having experienced varying levels of success in establishing self sufficient stands of coastal sage scrub (*Artemsia californica*) at UCSB's NCOS, managers had began to wonder what possible drivers of these differences are. I am currently mentoring a McNair Scholar project alongside my advisor, Dr. Jennifer King. The project is investigating the potential effects of bulk density and soil compaction on the success of coastal sage scrub establishment at UCSB's North Campus Open Space.

# Past Projects

## Post-Debris Flow Landcover Change in Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve 

For my masters thesis, I investigated how vegetation landcover changed in Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve following the 2018 Montecito debris flows. I accomplished this through a time series of Sentinel-2 images and random forest classification methods. After my analysis, I concluded while there was a general trend in green vegetation to pre-debris flow conditions, there was a measurable change in the areal extent of vegetation type with high marsh vegetation transitioning to mid marsh vegetation in regions that initially showed an increase in bare soil cover following the debris flows. These results were uniquely quantifiable using remote sensing techniques and show that disturbance due to debris flows may affect ecosystem function, including decreased primary productivity and decreased resilience to further disturbance. These impacts will need to be taken into consideration when managing wetlands prone to depositional events.
