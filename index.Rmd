I am a PhD Student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at UC Santa Barbara's [Department of Geography](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/) working with [Jennifer King](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/jennifer-king), [Dar Roberts](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/dar-roberts), and [Ian Walker](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/ian-walker).

I am a biophysical geographer with an interest in coastal wetland ecosystems.  My research interests are in remote sensing, biogeochemistry, and other biophysical processes of coastal wetlands. I largely focus on wetland landscape and spatial response to disturbance and environmental change. Some questions I've tackled include drought impacts, post-debris flow landcover change, and soil density influence on *Artemisia californica* establishment. When I'm not running around in marshes or hard at work processing images, I can be found doing nature photography, cooking, binge watching Netflix, catching Pokemon, and taking plenty of walks with the dog.
