I am a PhD Student at UC Santa Barbara's [Department of Geography](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/) working with [Jennifer King](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/jennifer-king), [Dar Roberts](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/dar-roberts), and [Ian Walker](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/ian-walker).

I am currently funded by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Progam and UCSB's Eugene Cota-Robles Fellowship. My research interests are in remote sensing, biogeochemistry, and other biophysical processes of coastal wetlands. I largely focus on wetland landscape and spatial response to disturbance and environmental change. Previous work has looked at plant response to drought, landcover change following debris flows, and soil property influence on plant establishment success. Additionally, I have strong interests in restored and managed wetlands and the ways that our understanding and management of them can be benefited and improved by data and data science.
